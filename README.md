# Docker Guide 2025 🐳🚀

Hi! I’m **Venkata Rahul Chinta**, a Master’s student at Saint Louis University (graduating May 2025) in Computer and Information Sciences. As I prepare for a DevOps career, I’m sharing my Docker learning journey here—hoping it helps others and invites feedback, corrections, and references from the community!

I’m actively seeking internship or full-time opportunities in DevOps, and this repo is part of my hands-on upskilling in Docker, containerization, and modern DevOps practices.  
**Special thanks to [Abhishek Veeramalla](https://www.youtube.com/@AbhishekVeeramalla) for his outstanding Docker playlist on YouTube! 🙏**
